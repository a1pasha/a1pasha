### ‚ö° [Dielectrophoretic Capacitive Sensor](https://github.com/a1pasha/dielectrophoretic-capacitive-sensor)
**Microfluidic sensor for liquid identification | University of Bremen Lab Project**

A capacitive sensor I developed at IMSAS that identifies liquids by their electrical properties. Using tiny electrodes on a silicon chip, it can tell the difference between water, ethanol, and isopropanol with over 90% accuracy in under 5 seconds.

- Designed and simulated electrode geometry using COMSOL Multiphysics
- Fabricated in a cleanroom using photolithography with gold electrodes
- Created a custom 3D printed holder with integrated microfluidic channels
